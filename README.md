KEY VAULT: A PASSWORD MANAGER USING AES 256 ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM

## Introduction
A password is considered the most popular method of authentication due to its cost-effectiveness and simplicity. However, people create weak and short passwords, reuse the same password for multiple accounts, write them down, and include personal information. Because of human memory limitations, users find it difficult to memorize strong, long, and random passwords that are hard to crack.

In response to these problems, several tools have been developed to help people handle their passwords, such as random password generators and password managers. Password managers provide a mechanism for users to create, store, and fill strong, unique passwords. Password managers are a solution that helps companies and private users in structuring their passwords and login credentials. The number of systems accessed daily has increased, and restrictions to create secure passwords become harder to satisfy. Password managers have to be secure, as people trust these applications with their secrets [4]. To help the users to remember all the passwords there are password managers, these are like databases that store all the passwords and the user needs only one password to access them. 

Not only do password managers help securely house the passwords, but they can also generate passwords that are unique and complex, which makes them more difficult to crack or guess. To do this, password managers use encryption algorithms.Although a password is considered the first line of defense in protecting online accounts, there are issues with users handling their passwords, such as password reuse and difficulty memorizing them. Password managers can be a potential approach for assisting people in properly managing their login credentials.
